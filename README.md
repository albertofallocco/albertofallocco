Hi!
Let me introduce myself:

I'm Alberto,
I recently graduated from my MSc in Statistics, with a thesis in machine learning (you'll find all about it in the specific repo, if you're interested!)
Also, I am currently looking for a job, of course as a data scientist.

On this page you'll find my main projects.
Have a good one!
